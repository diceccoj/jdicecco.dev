            Created an educational game in Unity and C# by implementing assets
            and code, developing the user interface, and incorporating
            additional features to allow for informative/engaging game play.
            Worked with designers and artists to create and implement assets
            into the game. Translated visual ideas into code and ensure that all
            coding operates appropriately in addition to prototyping game play
            and developing multiple iterations to create a high-quality product.

            Utilized Sobeyâ€™s IRI data, Walmart Retail Link, and the Metro
            database throughout data extraction and CSV file downloads. I used
            Power Automate to download those CSV files, Python to convert those
            files to their proper Excel format, and then uploaded the data to a
            cloud for them to be visualized for easier understanding. Also
            gained training in PowerBI near the end of my contract.

            Performed 200+ representments and declines daily without sacrificing
            compliance with necessary regulations or quality control/assurance

            clients' financial status, provide updates, and perform internal
            file modifications/updates as needed, ensuring the privacy and
            confidentiality of client data. Utilized the Echelon database to
