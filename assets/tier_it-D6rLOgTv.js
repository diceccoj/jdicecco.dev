It was great and consise but it did not have the best tools to use Firebase with. However, I now know that Godot allows users to use C# and GDScript in the same project. C# obviously has much better Firebase tools, so I don't think it would be too hard to implement better database management code while leaving the rest of the game alone. I also want to add other features to the game, such as allowing players to rank objects rather than people. For example, let's say you add a "best fruit" category, and have each player in your room to rank various fruit.`})]})})]}),e.jsxs(t,{children:[e.jsx(a,{id:"Gallery",children:"Gallery"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"flex justify-center items-center mt-20",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"responsive-grid lg:w-2/3  place-items-center",children:[e.jsx(s,{src:"/pages/tier_it/1.png",image_size:"large",bonus_classes:"rotate-[-3deg]",children:"This is where you create a room.
